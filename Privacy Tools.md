# Privacy Tools I Actually Use (And You Might Want To Consider)

Look, I'm not going to pretend I'm some cybersecurity expert, but after falling down the privacy rabbit hole a few years ago, I've picked up some tools that actually work for me. No, they won't make you invisible online (nothing will), but they'll at least stop you from being the easiest target in the room.

## Browsers That Don't Spy On You (As Much)

I bounced between a few before settling:

- **Firefox** has been my go-to for about 2 years now. It's not perfect, but with a few tweaks in the settings and some add-ons, it's pretty solid. The Mozilla team seems to actually care about privacy, which is refreshing.

- **Brave** works well when I need something Chromium-based for that occasional site that breaks in Firefox. Yes, I know they had that affiliate link controversy a while back, but they've been pretty decent since. Just remember to turn off their crypto stuff if you don't care about it.

- I tried **LibreWolf** for a while (it's basically Firefox with privacy settings cranked to 11), but honestly, it broke too many websites for my daily use. Your mileage may vary.

## Search Engines (Because Google Knows Enough About Me)

- **DuckDuckGo** is what I use 90% of the time. It's not perfect â€“ their Microsoft deal raised some eyebrows â€“ but it's WAY better than Google. The bang commands (like !w for Wikipedia) are genuinely useful once you get used to them.

- **Startpage** is my backup when DDG doesn't give me what I need. It basically gives you Google results without the Google tracking, though I'm skeptical about how that works long-term.

- I keep hearing about **Searx** instances, but setting one up seemed like a pain, and the public ones I tried were either slow or down half the time. Maybe someday.

## Password Managers (Because My Memory Sucks)

Seriously, if you're not using one yet, START TODAY. I cannot stress this enough.

- **Bitwarden** is what I use now and love it. Open source, works everywhere, and the free version does everything I need. The premium is like $10/year if you want the extra features.

- Used **LastPass** for years until their breach(es). The transition to Bitwarden was surprisingly painless. Don't miss LastPass at all.

- Tried **KeePassXC** briefly, but syncing between devices was a hassle. Great if you're ultra-paranoid though.

## VPNs (Yes, They're Oversold, But Still Useful)

I roll my eyes at those YouTube sponsorships too, but VPNs do have legitimate uses:

- **Mullvad** is my current choice. No email needed, can pay with cash or crypto, and they seem to actually care about privacy. Not the fastest, but I trust them more than most.

- Used **ProtonVPN** for a while with my Proton Mail subscription. It was fine, just a bit slow sometimes.

- **NordVPN** and **ExpressVPN** friends swear by them, but I'm skeptical of any VPN with a massive marketing budget. Where's that money coming from? ðŸ¤”

## Email (The Necessary Evil)

- **ProtonMail** has been my main for 3+ years. The free tier is limiting (only 500MB), but the basic paid plan isn't too expensive for what you get.

- Still have a **Gmail** account because, well, try living without one. I just don't use it for anything important anymore.

- **SimpleLogin** for email aliases is FANTASTIC. Create unlimited throwaway emails that forward to your real one. Game changer for signing up for sketchy services.

## Final Thoughts

The hardest thing about privacy is finding the balance between paranoia and convenience. I've found myself going down extreme rabbit holes where I was self-hosting everything and breaking basic functionality, then swinging back to convenience at the cost of privacy.

These days I aim for the 80/20 rule - the tools above give me about 80% of the privacy protection with only 20% of the hassle. And honestly, that's good enough for my threat model.

What tools are you using? Drop me an email (through one of those fancy encrypted services, of course).

P.S. Don't fall for those "rent-a-hacker" scams. They're ALL scams. Anyone with actual hacking skills isn't advertising on the dark web for $50 a job. Come on.
